        Charades is a word guessing game.
        A player acts out the word on the screen, while other player(s) try to guess the word.
        \n\n
        Interesting Features:
        \n
        1. There is an in-built timer, so you do not have to worry about a physical stopwatch.
        \n\n
        2. You don\'t have to necessarily keep count. You can just try to beat the high score.
        \n\n
        I had fun making this, and hope you have fun playing it.
        \n
